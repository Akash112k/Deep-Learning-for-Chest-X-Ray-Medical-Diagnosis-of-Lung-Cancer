# Deep-Learning-for-Chest-X-Ray-Medical-Diagnosis-of-Lung-Cancer

* Spearheaded the development of an advanced automated system for lung cancer diagnosis using state-of-the-art deep learning models,
including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
* Leveraged the extensive NIH Clinical Center dataset comprising 100,000 annotated chest X-ray images to rigorously train and validate
the model, achieving exceptional accuracy and generalization in disease prediction.
* Prioritized early detection to significantly improve patient outcomes, ensuring the systemâ€™s scalability and accessibility for widespread
clinical application and enhanced healthcare efficiency.
